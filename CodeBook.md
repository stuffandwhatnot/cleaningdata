The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions 
related to the project. You will be required to submit: 

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data 
called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work 
and how they are connected.  

This code book describes the variable names that are used to produce the UCI_tidy.txt from running the script found in run_analysis.R. 

In the subsequent UCI_tidy.txt file, the "subject" means the identification of the subject on whom the observations are made.  There are a total of 30 subjects and therefore numbered 1-30. 

The "activity" stands for the test that was completed by a given subject, which include the following: 
-laying
-sitting
-standing
-walking
-walking downstairs
-walking upstairs
